What is Time Series Forecasting?

Making scientific projections based on data with historical time stamps is known as time series forecasting. It entails creating models through historical study, using them to draw conclusions and guide strategic decision-making in the future.

The fact that the future result is wholly unknown at the time of the task and can only be anticipated through thorough analysis and evidence-based priors is an essential distinction in forecasting.

Numpy:

NumPy is a Python library used for working with arrays. It also has functions for working in the domain of linear algebra and matrices. It is an open-source project, and you can use it freely. NumPy stands for Numerical Python.

Pandas:

Pandas is a software library written for the Python programming language for data manipulation and analysis. In particular, it offers data structures and operations for manipulating numerical tables and time series.

Seaborn:

Seaborn is an open source python library based on matplotlib is called seaborn. It is utilized for data exploration and data visualization, with data frames and the pandas libraries seaborn function with ease.
Matplotlib - For python and its numerical extension numpy, matplotlib is a cross platform for data visualization and graphical charting package, as a result it presents a strong open source substitute. The APIs allow programmers to incorporate graphs into GUI applications.

Linear Regression - The machine learning method, regression built on linear supervised learning. analysis regression is done. Regression creates a value for the aim prediction using independent variable as inputs. Its main goal is to investigate the relationship between factors and forecasting.

Exponential smoothening - The exponential windows function is a general method for smoothing time series data known as exponential smoothening. It contrasts to the ordinary moving average which weights previous data quality. Exponential function use weights that decrease exponentially with time.
Simple exponential smoothening - Simple exponential smoothening classes use simple exponential smoothening models to give very simple time series analysis, a weight average of the most recent value and the preceding smooth value constitute the predicted value, the constribution of older valued degrade exponentially as a result of this smoothening parameters.

We would be creating different graph for EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)

Coefficient of variation
Coefficient of variation CV is a statiscal measure of the relative dispersion of data points in a data series around the mean. In finance the coefficient of variation allows investors to determine how much mortality or risks is assumed in comparison of the amount (amount in return expected by investors) the lower the ratio of the standard deviation to mean, the better risk return trade-off.

Model formation is done using linear regression.

MAPE - MAPE is a meausre of prediction of accuracy in a forecasting model.
